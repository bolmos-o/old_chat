# chat

Simple local chat made with nodejs.

Build the app with "npm run build". Launch the chat-server with "npm start". Launch the CLI chat-client with "npm run client [USERNAME]". 
The browser version of the client should be available on the address http://localhost:3000/; the port can be changed if it is already taken.
